# RNA-seq-workflow

This is a simple workflow to do analysis on RNA seq data and make some plots. The input is the Kallisto alignment result (.tsv) files and following the workflow in order will generate:
 - differential expression dataframes
 - Summary table of gene changes
 - Principal component (PCA) plot
 - Sample distance plot
 - Mean average (MA) plot
 - Volcano plot
 - Heatmap of the top n variance genes
 - Pathway enrichment using GO
